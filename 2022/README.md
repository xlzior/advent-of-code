# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code (AoC) is a yearly coding challenge in the form of an Advent calendar. Every day from Dec 1 to 25, a small programming puzzle is released and hundreds of thousands of people attempt to solve the problems.

This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles in Advent of Code 2022.
